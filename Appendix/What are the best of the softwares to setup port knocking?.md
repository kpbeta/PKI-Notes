Based on the search results, here are some of the best software options for setting up port knocking:

1. knockd: This is a popular port knocking daemon for Linux systems. It's widely used and can be configured to open specific ports when the correct sequence of "knocks" is received[3](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=349266).
    
2. iptables/nftables: These Linux firewall tools can be used to implement port knocking without additional software. They utilize the "recent" module to create dynamic lists of IP addresses based on connection attempts[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
    
3. fwknop: This software provides both port knocking and Single Packet Authorization (SPA). It offers enhanced security features compared to simpler port knocking methods, using libpcap and cryptographic methods to examine incoming packets[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
    

4. KnockOnD: This is an iOS app that serves as a simple port knocking client. It's compatible with knockd and other port knocking servers, supporting both UDP and TCP protocols[1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/knockond/id333206277).
    
5. knock: This is a command-line tool that often comes bundled with knockd. It's simple to use and available for various operating systems[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
    
6. nmap: While primarily a network scanning tool, nmap can be used to perform port knocking sequences[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
    
7. Custom scripts: Simple shell scripts or PowerShell scripts can be created to automate the port knocking process using basic networking tools like nmap or netcat[4](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/knock-knock-who-s-there/ba-p/417975)[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
    

When implementing port knocking, it's important to remember that it should be used as part of a broader security strategy, not as the sole protection mechanism. Combining port knocking with other security measures, such as SSH keys for SSH protection, provides a more robust security setup[6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Port_knocking).
